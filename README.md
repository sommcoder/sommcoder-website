# SOMMCODER WEBSITE

This is my portfolio and freelancer website/hub!

It is built using React.js, CSS with styled-components library and JavaScript hosted on Google's BaaS called Firebase.

All of the components, transitions and animations are 100% custom made. I am by no means a UX/UI designer however I'm fairly proud of what I was able to come up with based on replicating existing UI standards/benchmarks.

This is designed to be a mobile-first, single page site and implements responsive design with multiple screen breakpoints allowing the site to offer a great UX at all screen sizes. Would have loved to try to get some experience using the relatively new CSS Containers however I just used the more classic CSS Media Queries to achieve this.

The site has been tested on Chrome, Firefox and Edge and with minimal visual differences, it should be the same experience across these major browsers.

Would love to recreate this site using the relatively new Astro framework, especially if I ever get into more documentation and/or blogging for my projects. The SSR nature of Astro and how it serves primarily HTML and CSS to the browser seems to be more performant than serving a bunch of JavaScript which is what this current project does.

I've used Vite as my build tool which I prefer over create-react-app.
