Component relationships are inferred by their hierarchy and so JSSX avoids the need to imperatively 'link' child components to their parents, this is all transpiled for you. Additionally, ids are autogenerated with a 'cust_page' prefix and follows a consistent naming convention across the UI that's transpiled",
